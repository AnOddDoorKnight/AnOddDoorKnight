I'm a Self-Taught Junior Developer, who took programming as a hobby. 
Currently looking for some constructive critisism on my work whenever i release it, and (hopefully) people use my work!
Still too self-concious about my work to contribute to any other projects other than my own, however.

I Currently know C#, Unity, and a small amount of Python
