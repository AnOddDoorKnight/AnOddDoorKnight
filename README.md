I'm a Self-Taught **C# Developer** or more specifically a **Unity Game Developer**, who took programming as a hobby. It involves around general knowledge of the language and specifically more about game design. Most I have worked extensively about is string manipulation, linq queries & data, and physics with a small amount of Quaternions. Currently looking for some constructive critisism on my work whenever I release it, and (hopefully) people use my work!

Games I have worked on:
- **Hideous Destructor** as project manager/game programmer
- **B1NARY** as Senior Programmer; not monitoring any people in the field, though. The previous programmer left the proj.
