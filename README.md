I'm a Self-Taught **C# Developer** or more specifically a **Unity Game Developer**, who took programming as a hobby. It involves around general knowledge of the language and specifically more about game design. Most I have worked extensively about is string manipulation, linq queries & data, and physics with a small amount of Quaternions.
Currently looking for some constructive critisism on my work whenever I release it, and (hopefully) people use my work!
